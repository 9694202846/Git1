  <!-- Hi Abhijit,

Please consider this email as my resignation from my current position. Please accept this letter as a formal notification of my resignation from the position of Salesforce Developer with TCS.
I would like to thank you for giving me an opportunity to work in this position for the past 1.6 years. It was great working experience with the company and I thoroughly enjoyed and appreciated the opportunities I got within the team.

During my official notice period, I will ensure a smooth transition by wrapping up all my duties as well as train my successors/teammates. Please feel free to let me know if thereâ€™s anything else I can do to aid in a smooth transition, during my stay.
